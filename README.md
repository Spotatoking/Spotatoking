About me:
I'm currently a first year Indian B.Tech student of the discipline Energy Engineering. I am currently in my first semester. 

My coding goals by the end of this semester's break(1st January):
Learn Basics of Github and Git 
Learn C and C # coding languages to a beginner level(dunno what this entails yet, but I'll get there)

My hobbies:
Playing Badminton, reading sci fi and epic and dark fanstasy novels. Also like playing rpgs on all available platforms

Why am I learning coding?
To have an alternative to fallback on in case my discipline's core placements do not work out for me.<!--[also actually want to go into game development, but am too scared to make the decision rn]>
